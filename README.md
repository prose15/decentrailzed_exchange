I created this app using React and Firebase because I'm not familiar with NEXT.js, but I think it's just a newer version of React, so I'll learn it quickly. Here's what I've done for the assignment:

1) Swapping Process : 
   
   *Two input boxes:    
      *First one for entering the amount to exchange.
      *Option tag to select the crypto coins.
      *Second one shows the converted amount.

2) Authentication:
    *Added authentication for users.

3) Transfers History:
    *Added a section to view transaction history.

4) Logout Button:
    *Enabled a logout button for users to sign out.
